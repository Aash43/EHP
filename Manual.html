        <p>
            <b> Step 4: </b> Go back the web browser and make sure that the exam.net website is in focus by just clicking anywhere in it except on the start test button. 
            You can see if it is in focus if the chrome icon on the taskbar is a little more gray then the other icons.

            <b> Step 5: </b> Press control + shift + j. A box should now appear on the right side of your browser. Click on that box so it has the focus. 
            You can see if it has the focus if this "|" appears in the box and start to blick.

        <p> DON'T THOUCH ANYTHING and wait until the program is done.
            This should take about 15 - 20 seconds and you know when it is done when the box on the side disappears.

        <p>
            <b> Step 7: </b> Now when EHP(exam hack program) is done you should press control + alt + s to close it. Now you can go in and out of the exam without the website seeing you cheating.
            <br> <b> IMPORTANT: </b>If something went wrong or it did not work, go to the "How to do it manually" section and try that one instead.

        <hr width="100%" align="left" >

        <p> <b> Step 2: </b> Press control + shift + j in the website</p>
        <p> <b> Step 3: </b> Open the commands.txt file which is located in the resource directory </p>

        <h2 id="HowDoesItWork"> How does it work </h2>
        <hr width="100%" align="left" >
        <p><b> Disclammer: Some stuff I say here may not be true because I do not now 100%. I mostly say what my theory is using logical guessing and thinking but I may be wrong. </b></p>
        <p><b> Command1: </b> document.getElementsByClassName("btn btn-lg secondaryStyle noCapitalize big")[0].click(); </p>
        <p> What this command does is that it finds the first element of the docuemnt object that has the class name "btn btn-lg secondaryStyle noCapitalize big" and clicks it. (It clicks the start test button).</p>
        <p> This is going to start the test and make you fullscreen. </p>
        <p> You need to do this command, instead of pressing the button, because now your focus will be outside the test when you start instead of inside. </p>
        <p> This is good because the blur event(the event that detectes when you leave the website) is only triggered if the website has focus and then loses it.</p>
        <p> This time thought the website never had any focus which meant that the event never got triggerd. </p>
        <p> This is why you can go back to your file without getting detected cheating </p>
        <p><b> Command2: </b> window.removeEventListener('blur', getEventListeners(window).blur[0].listener); </p>
        <p> This command finds the first blur event listener in the window element and removes it. (Removes the blur event listener). </p>
        <p> This means that you now can give focus to the websit and then change the focus without getting detected for cheating. The website will thought still detect fullscreen change which we still need to remove. </p>
        <p><b> Command3: </b> document.removeEventListener("fullscreenchange" ,getEventListeners(document).fullscreenchange[0].listener); </p>
        <p> This command finds the first fullscreenchange event listener in the docuemnt element and removes it. (Removes the fullscreenchange event listener).
        <p><b> The OK checkers: </b> There is also another event that is changing the fullscreen value from true to false if you are going out of fullscreen that we can't remove </p>
        <p> The "OK" things is just a function that gets called when the test starts. It loops 12 times and is checking if the fullscreen variable is true and if it is true it will print out "OK". </p>
        <p> If it detects that the fullscreen variable is false then the website will say that you are cheating </p>
        <p> We need to wait until it has finished checking before exiting fullscreen because if we would exit then the other event listener would trigger and change the fullscreen value to false and the OK things would see that the fullscreen value is false and say that you are cheating. </p>
